# AllergicHiker

We are on a square grid that is **infinite** in all **positive** directions. Negative coordinates are not allowed.

#### Player 1: Allergic hiker
A poor *Allergic Hiker*, whom the user controls via the prompt:
* WASD (W=‚¨ÜÔ∏è, A=‚¨ÖÔ∏è, S=‚¨áÔ∏è, D=‚û°Ô∏è)
* OLUR (Oben=‚¨ÜÔ∏è, Links=‚¨ÖÔ∏è, Unten=‚¨áÔ∏è, Rechts=‚û°Ô∏è for German speakers)
 
#### Player 2: Polen
A wind-carried *Polen* is controlled by the computer.

#### Rules
* Both players can move one position to the left, right, up or down at a time
* The *Polen* makes its move after each move of the *Allergic Hiker*

If the *Polen* is at a distance of <=4 from the *Allergic Hiker*, there is a 50% probability of causing an allergic reaction, i.e. Game Over! ü§ß
